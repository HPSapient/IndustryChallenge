# Introduction

## Purpose

- Design an Intelligent Virtual Assistant (IVA) to guide users through a series of simple questions to determine what’s needed for an individualized, flexible experience and then respond with personalized information and proactive services. 
- The IVA will be accessible on all channels: the company website, existing mobile app, and third-party platforms such as Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant.

	- Shall work with fulfilment layer and carry out business transactions.
	- Shall showcase learning from past conversations and following the user journey across touch points: If user starts interacting on mobile app and then carries the conversation on Alexa, user should not repeat itself.
- Shall apply a ML algorithm to identify and learn new details about the user – likes and dislikes, history of interacting with the brand, social profile. 
- Shall be channel-agonistic and should be able to integrate with any device/channel  (e.g. Mobile App, Website, Alexa) with minimum effort.
