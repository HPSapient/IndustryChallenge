# Industry Challenge - Travel & Hospitality


## Creating the Next-Gen traveler ecosystem driven by Cognitive Experiences - Intelligent Customer Interactions 
 
The travel and hospitality industry represents one of the largest and fastest growing sectors in the world reaching $1.6T in 2017 and 10.2% of the GLOBAL GDP. Today’s travelers want to experience something magical, something personal in a frictionless manner while the hosts want to provide the same in a most cost-effective manner and strive for operational excellence. How can we create an effective data driven conversational ecosystem that is ubiquitous, interacts and learns with the guests directly in their own world to create magical memories while providing the hosts the tools to provide seamless service to the guests? 
 
Hospitality businesses have made an enormous progress in the past decade changing the experiences they deliver to customers in both the physical and digital worlds. But it is still not sufficient. 
Customers are more demanding than ever. They also have more power than they used to. Not to mention that they are smarter and have higher expectations than ever before. Indeed, they expect great results. 
  
## A New Way of Doing Things: 
 
No longer will customers be forced down a predetermined, one size fits all, user path. 
Intelligent Virtual Assistants (IVA) will guide users through a series of simple questions to determine what’s needed, then respond with personalized information and proactive services.  
 
The shortest distance between a brand and a customer is a conversation. IVA goes where your customers go: On a website, inside an existing app, on third-party platforms like Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and Facebook Messenger. Think of IVA as an omni channel assistant designed to make your customer’s life simpler by delivering the right information at the right moment, on any channel. 
 
  
## Expected Product: 
 
1. An intelligent virtual assistance, which has abilities to drive meaningful One on One conversations, carry out business transactions and solve customer problems. 
2. When you interact with IVA, it knows you, it applies the ML algorithms to identify the details – your personality, your likes and dislikes, your history of interacting with the brand, your emotion, your social profile. In both ways 

	a. As a member  
	b. As a non-member 
3. Ability to model a non-member based on his traits and third-party data. 
4. The product has to be channel agonistic, and should be able to integrate with any device/channel with minimum effort. 
5. IVA should be able to learn from its conversations about the individual customer, and also over all as conversational AI.    
 
## Acceptance Criteria: 

1. Integration of the IVA with at-least 3 channels (e.g. - Mobile App, Website, Alexa Show) 
2. Ability to showcase it can learn from past conversations and can continue the user journey across touch points: If user starts interacting on mobile app and then carries the conversation on Alexa, user should not repeat itself. 
3. Ability to identify and analyze the customer and his tone, also modify the output and derive the next best action. 
4. Ability to work with fulfilment layer, and carry out business transactions. 
5. Data Security: IVA should give user a confidence that his data is secure, and at backed there should be check and balances for user data security
